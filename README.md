# PicoCTF Writeups

This repository contains my learning and writeups from PicoCTF challenges across different categories such as Cryptography, Web Exploitation, Reverse Engineering, and more.

The goal of this repository is to help other cybersecurity learners understand challenge-solving approaches and get unstuck while learning. Each writeup focuses on the key idea, tools used, and steps taken to reach the solution.

Happy hacking and learning! 🚀🔐
