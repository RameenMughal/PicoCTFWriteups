We see 4 network packets having information such as Protcol, Source and Destination IP Addresses and much more.

One unique thing is the S101 protocol at pacekt 4 as others are TCP to maintain the communication.

**Note**: The S101 protocol (s101) is a specialized transport protocol used to carry messages.

Click the Packet 4 to see additional information then you see the flag!
