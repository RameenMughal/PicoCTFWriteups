## Solution

As the flag format is PICOCTF{}, it is an A1Z26 cipher (1=A, 2=B, … 26=Z).

The Letter-to-Number Cipher (or Number-to-Letter Cipher or numbered alphabet) consists in replacing each letter by its position in the alphabet, for example A=1, B=2, Z=26, hence its over name A1Z26.

The first part `16 9 3 15 3 20 6` → `P I C O C T F`

The second part under `{}` will be `20 8 5 14 21 13 2 5 18 19 13 1 19 15 14` → `T H E N U M B E R S M A S O N`

So combining the first and second part will get the full flag!
