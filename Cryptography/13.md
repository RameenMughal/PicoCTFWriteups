# 13

## Description

Cryptography can be easy, do you know what ROT13 is? 

`cvpbPGS{abg_gbb_onq_bs_n_ceboyrz}`

## Solution

The description references ROT13, a well-known cipher that shifts each letter by 13 positions using the formula (x + 13) mod 26.

Since the alphabet length is 26, applying ROT13 twice returns the original text.

Putting the ciphertext in [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) website and selecting ROT13 with `amount = 13` (by default), then we get the flag!
