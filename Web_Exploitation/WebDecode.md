# 🕸️🔍 WebDecode

## Description

Do you know how to use the web inspector?

After launching the instance, there are three options **Home**, **About** and **Contact**.

## Solution

I checked source of Home, About and Contact so I see encoded something in the **About** page i.e. `notify_true="cGljb0NURnt3ZWJfc3VjYzNzc2Z1bGx5X2QzYzBkZWRfMDdiOTFjNzl9"`

Putting this text in [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) and with the magic wand option I see this is **Base64** encoded and then we get the flag!
