# 🔽📦 Unminify

## Description

I don't like scrolling down to read the code of my website, so I've squished it. As a bonus, my pages load faster!

## Solution

The description suggest to look at the code of the website so I checked the source code of the website by right clicking and choosing "view page source" of the web page.

The code of the website is only in one line so it makes readibility a little uneasy but we can still check by selecting the bar to slide to the right.

By going to the right, the flag is there in the class=""!
