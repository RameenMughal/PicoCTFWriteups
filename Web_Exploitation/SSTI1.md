This indictaes the SSTI (Server Side Template Injection) Vulnerability!

----

### SSTI Overview

SSTI (Server-Side Template Injection) is a web security vulnerability that happens when user input is inserted into a server-side template and executed as template code instead of plain text.

In simple words: If a web app uses templates (like Jinja2, Twig, Velocity, Freemarker) and does not properly sanitize user input, an attacker can inject template expressions that the server will evaluate, leading to data leakage or even remote code execution.

To test the vulnerability we will check {{7*7}} so it should give 49 and it is confirmed!
