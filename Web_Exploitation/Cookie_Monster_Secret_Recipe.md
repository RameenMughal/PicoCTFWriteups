### Method 1: Inspect the Web page

Going to Inspect by right clicking and then going to the **Applications** tab, we see Cookies and under this with the website link we get the Cookie Value of this web page `cGljb0NURntjMDBrMWVfbTBuc3Rlcl9sMHZlc19jMDBraWVzX0E2RkEwN0Q4fQ`

### Method 2: Through `curl` Command

We can see the content of the web page through curl command.

As it is a login page login.php we will do `curl -I http://verbal-sleep.picoctf.net:PORT/login.php`, so we get our cookie value `cGljb0NURntjMDBrMWVfbTBuc3Rlcl9sMHZlc19jMDBraWVzX0E2RkEwN0Q4fQ`
